# Emulsify Design System

Emulsify is a full Design System encompassing both a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)/[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) development environment, a customizable Styleguide powered by [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) 8 starterkit theme. The new ecosystem breaks these into separate parts depending on your project's needs.

### Storybook + Drupal

Emulsify is a full prototyping development environment using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a Pattern Library and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as a build engine. It is also a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) 8 theme. It can be used as a standalone prototyping tool or inside a Drupal installation. It supports both Twig and React components!
