Emulsify is an open-source tool for creating design systems with reusable components and clear guidelines for teams. Emulsify helps organizations scale their design while reducing cost, streamlining workflows, and improving accessibility.

## Storybook + Drupal

Emulsify is a full prototyping development environment using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a component library and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as a build engine. It is also a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) 8 theme. It can be used as a standalone prototyping tool or inside a Drupal installation. It supports both Twig and React components out of the box! Because it's using Storybook, any number of languages an be supported with the correct configuration.
