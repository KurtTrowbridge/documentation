# Emulsify Design System

The new Emulsify is a full-fledged Design System encompassing both a Storybook/Webpack development environment, a customizable Styleguide powered by [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and a Drupal 8 theme. These can be used together or separately based on your need. Below is a breakdown of the ecosystem:

### Storybook + Drupal

Emulsify is a full prototyping development environment using Storybook as a Pattern Library and Webpack as a build engine. It is also a Drupal 8 theme. The development environment can be used as a standalone prototyping tool or inside a Drupal installation. See below for quick links for both:

* Installation: Drupal \| Standalone
* Usage: Drupal \| Standalone

### Styleguide \(coming early 2020\)

Emulsify Design System contains a fully customizable Styleguide powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). The Styleguide is simply a Gatsby theme, and instructions for installation and the project can be found [here](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/gatsby-theme-emulsify).
