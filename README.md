# Emulsify Design System

The new Emulsify is a full-fledged Design System encompassing both a customizable Styleguide powered by GatsbyJS, a Storybook/Webpack development environment and a Drupal 8 theme. These can be used together or separately based on your need. Below is a breakdown of the ecosystem:

### Styleguide \(coming early 2020\)

Emulsify Design System contains a fully customizable Styleguide powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). The Styleguide is simply a Gatsby theme, and instructions for installation and the project can be found [here](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/gatsby-theme-emulsify).

### Pattern Library + Drupal

There are also Gatsby starters in the Emulsify ecosystem, one of which is for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/). It contains a Pattern Library and development environment powered by [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and is a Drupal 8 theme. That project can be found [here](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/gatsby-starter-emulsify-drupal).
