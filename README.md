# Emulsify Design System

Emulsify is a full Design System encompassing a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) development environment, a customizable style guide powered by [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), as well as some other projects like a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) 8 starter kit theme. The new ecosystem breaks these into separate parts depending on your project's needs.

### Storybook + Drupal

Emulsify is a full prototyping development environment using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a component library and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as a build engine. It is also a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) 8 theme. It can be used as a standalone prototyping tool or inside a Drupal installation. It supports both Twig and React components out of the box! Because it's using Storybook, any number of languages an be supported with the correct configuration.
